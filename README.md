# Video Scene Detection and Segmentation

This script is designed to process a video file, detect different scenes within it, and export segmented clips based on scene changes. The detection is performed using Structural Similarity (SSIM) between consecutive frames. If the SSIM value falls below a specified threshold, a new scene is identified, and the corresponding segment is exported.

## Requirements
